# Tone Rebuilder

This project is focused on audio synthesis and processing. It allows users to analyze, synthesize, and modify audio signals using various digital signal processing techniques.

## Overview

The Tone Rebuilder provides capabilities for:
- Audio analysis and visualization
- Sound synthesis
- Audio filtering and processing
- Applying effects like reverb


## Dependencies

The project requires the following Python libraries:
- numpy: For numerical operations
- matplotlib: For visualization
- librosa: For audio and music analysis
- scipy: For signal processing
- sounddevice: For audio playback
- soundfile: For audio file I/O

## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python setup_venv.py
   ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```
   source activate.sh
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook notebook.ipynb
   ```

## Usage

The notebook is organized into sections that demonstrate different audio processing techniques:

1. Analysis of input audio signals
2. Synthesis of new sounds
3. Filtering and processing of audio signals
4. Application of effects like reverb
5. Visualization of audio data using spectrograms
